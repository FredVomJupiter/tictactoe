# tictactoe
I wrote a simple tictactoe game with javascript without copy&pase from stackoverflow or other sources.
The computer A.I. is 100% coded from scratch using a tool called human brain. It is a simple A.I. but it works. So far I am only aware of one tactic to beat the A.I.. Have fun trying it out.
